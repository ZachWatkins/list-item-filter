# list-item-filter-box

A WordPress shortcode plugin that connects with adjacent list item elements to hide them based on what text is entered into the plugin's generated text input field.

Example usage: [listitem_filterbox placeholder="Filter this list by terms"]

Note: It can only be used once per page (for now).
